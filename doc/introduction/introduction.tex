The aim of this paper is to give a hand-on introduction to the how one can go from a rudimentary understanding of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, to simulating quantum chromodynamics on the lattice. In order to kick this is of, let us begin by discussing our end-goal, Quantum Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD).

QCD is the theory for interacting quarks and gluons. It has since its inception gotten a reputation notoriously difficult to work with, much because it is not linear due to its three- and four-vertex gluon self interactions.
